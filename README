You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc PeGS::PDF
	
If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc  lib/PeGS/PDF.pm
	
This module is also in Github:
